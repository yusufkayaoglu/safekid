## VMware Tanzu Spring Enterprise Extensions

You have selected to add [Tanzu Spring](https://www.vmware.com/products/app-platform/tanzu-spring) enterprise extensions to your project.
In order to use these enterprise extensions you must have authorized [access to the Spring Enterprise Subscription](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/spring/tanzu-spring/commercial/spring-tanzu/guide-artifact-repository-administrators.html) artifacts with an entitlement to Tanzu Spring.
To learn more about what is included with Tanzu Spring entitlement, check out [enterprise.spring.io](https://enterprise.spring.io/) for more information.

### Maven Parent overrides

Due to Maven's design, elements are inherited from the parent POM to the project POM.
While most of the inheritance is fine, it also inherits unwanted elements like `<license>` and `<developers>` from the parent.
To prevent this, the project POM contains empty overrides for these elements.
If you manually switch to a different parent and actually want the inheritance, you need to remove those overrides.
